Is not supported on Windows, so use Windows Subsystem for Linux (default Ubuntu installation)
Jupyter lab has to be instlled on WSL to use the notebook. Files are then copied to the project file on windows to allow for easy pushing to Github
Install 

Jupyter lab install did not work with the windows powershell installation for pip, so I attempted to do it in the WSL bash terminal
Commands run: 
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt install python3-pip
- apt install pipx
- pipx install jupyterlab
- pipx ensurepath
<reopen terminal>
- apt install jupyter-core
-jupyter-lab --allow-root
