Matthew Prem PHYS 265 Final Project: Pynbody and Topsy

If you are attempting to recreate the figures on a Windows system, first read part [6] of the report and run the commands in "WSL installation instructions.txt" to set up Jupyter lab

Once you have Jupyter lab set up, download "Final project.ipynb" and run all cells. The first few cells will make sure you have the necessary packages installed and download the source code for the packages for you to look through. Once the source code is installed, it will then install sample data and then create a figure of that sample data.

If you want an interactive visualization, run the cells in the section titled "Topsy Turvey". Due to the GPU requirements, it may not run on all systems. If it does not run on your system, try installing the latest graphics drivers for your graphics card and restart your system.
