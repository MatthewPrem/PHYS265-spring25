[1] The pynbody package is a python packaged creaed to allow for easy visualization of and interaction with the output files of a n-body program. This packages doesn not run n-body simulations itself, just allows for easy visualization of snapshots generated by the n-body simulators.

[2] I selected this package because I am rather intersted in n-body simulations, having attempted (unsuccessfuly, after writing a buggy kernel to dynaically resize the simulation domain) to create an interactive GPU n-body simulator while in high school. While I wanted to review a professional GPU acceerated N-body code, I wasn't able to find any that was purely python-based with the most performant programs written in C++, C, or Fortran. There is a Python version of CUDA, so it is definitally possible to create a GPU-accelerated n-body package purely in python, but I wasn't able to find any on ASCL. I figured the next closest thing was a highly parallized CPU n-body code, so I checked out the CONCEPT package, but found that it took a very long time to run, so I started looking at something more lightweight. At that point, I found Pynbody, a Python-centered package designed to visualize snapshots and other output files from more dedicated n-body code. I also learned that Pynbody had an interactive, GPU-accelerated addition called Topsy, which seemed to closely align with my original interestes in creating an interactive visualizer and I was interested in that, so I decided to do my projec
